The manipulation, analysis, augmentation, and interpretation of digital imagery are the main focus of the computer science and engineering discipline known as image processing. It consists of using various techniques and algorithms to alter or extract data from images to improve their or to gain insights from them. Image processing is a widely-used application across different fields such as medical imaging and remote sensing. It is often combined with machine learning and deep learning tools to develop advanced computer vision models that can categorise objects, detect outliers, and carry out decision making based on visual data.

The task was completed in Jupyter Notebook with the MNIST data set that was loaded using the sklearn library. The data was then split into training and test sets. Using the RandomForestClassifier from sklearn, a classification model was generated. A parameter was picked to be tuned and it was explained why it was chosen. The value n_estimators = 100 was selected for testing on the test data which is a good starting point to achieve stabilised performance and avoid overfitting. The confusion matrix for the random forest model on the test set was printed. Commentary was made on which classes the model struggled with the most, as well as the accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score.
